# geomoji

Like https://gitmoji.dev/, but for GIS

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The function of this project is to provide a consistent and standardized way to reference GIS element metadata using emoji.

This is useful for providing universal references to items in various contexts using icons which are intuitive, easily identifiable when scanning media, and not language dependent.

For more information on why this is deemed useful, please review [https://kartoza.github.io/docs/polyglot](https://kartoza.github.io/docs/polyglot)
